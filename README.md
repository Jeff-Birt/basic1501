# basic1501
Disassembly of basic1501 keyword extensions for Sharp PC-1500

Syntax is for TASM assembler using Sharp pneumonics. The version of TASM which was modified to support the Sharp lh5801 processor as well as the TASM extension for VS Cdoe can be found here: https://github.com/Jeff-Birt/TASM_vsCode_Extension 

A header for the CE-158 is automatically added to the output file. You could alter this to output a CE-150 header and then use sharttools to create a WAV file for loading if you wish.

A few minor changes were made to original code as noted.
